# README 

Hey there, this is my first React project. Its a To-do app with Authentication. Its made with React, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap and CSS modules. NOT Responsive. You can add tasks in 'my day' section, select them as completed by checking the input box or you can click the star icon to mark them as important and they will automatically be transfered to the 'important' section. If you checked them as completed, an Accordion component will be rendered on the screen, you can click on it and it will show you all of your completed tasks for the current section that you are in. You can also add a new list by clicking the '+ New List' button, which will render a new section named however you like. For example if you have a Side Project you can name it side project and add your tasks in there. This section functions like the other 2. You wont be able to add more than 1 'New List' section.

# How to run the project ?

1. npm install 
2. npm start

# Do NOT claim as yours!
# Hope you enjoy it :)
